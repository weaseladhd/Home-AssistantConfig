    <summary><b>The Automation Process:</b> 👈</summary>

      - **State Triggers:**
        - Define triggers based on entity state changes or numeric state changes (above or below a specified value).
        - Specify entities for both "Start Entities" and "End Entities." Both start and end entities serve as triggers.

      - **Notification Options:**
        - Option to send notifications to one or multiple devices when triggered.
        - Action Buttons (Optional):
            - Notifications can include up to 3 action buttons.
            - Each action button is linked to a designated custom action group.
            - Option to send a confirmation message when an action button is pressed.
            - The automation will continue after a specified time delay if an action button is not pressed.
        - Compatible with Apple iOS and Android devices.

      - **Custom Actions:**
        - Option to define up to 3 different action groups when triggered.
        - Each action group can contain as many actions as desired.
        - Each action group can be linked to a notification action button or executed automatically when the automation is triggered.

      - **Custom Conditions:**
          - Enter any custom conditions to further customize the automation process

            Please select what state you would like for your trigger.
            You can choose from ten options available in the dropdown menu.
            If your option is not in the dropdown menu then just type the state you would like to use in and click the save button.

            A numbering system has been implemented to facilitate navigation within the dropdown selections. Each number corresponds to a specific configuration,
            aiding users in identifying and adjusting the settings used within each selection. For instance, when selecting **8 - Numeric State - Above**
            as a dropdown option, settings marked **Used in options 8, 9 or 10** are required for that respective selection because number 8 is included in those options.

            Use a tag to keep your notifications organized.
            When a new notification with the same tag is sent, it replaces the old one, so you won't get cluttered with multiple notifications for the same appliance.


            You can use the same tag across start and end notifications to ensure only one active notification remains throughout the automation.


            If this input is left blank, no tag will be applied and each notification will be treated as separate.


            For best results, use short, unique tags for each automation - for example: `water-leak`, `garage-door`, `back-door-motion`, etc.

            On devices running iOS 15 and later, you can configure the interruption level for your notifications to ensure they are delivered according to your preferences.

            Critical and time-sensitive notifications must be turned ON within the Home Assistant App, and time-sensitive notifications must be allowed in your Focus settings.

            **High Priority** notifications ensure that you receive important alerts immediately.
            These notifications bypass normal delivery delays and are delivered instantly to your device.


            **Sticky Notification** ensure that important alerts are not dismissed when selected. They remain on your notification screen until you actively clear or swipe them away, ensuring that critical information stays visible until addressed.


            **Notification Channel** allow you to easily organize different notification settings,
            including notification sounds, vibrations, and other device-specific features.
            If you choose this option, please enter your desired channel name below.


            **Icon** allows you to replace the default Home Assistant icon with one of your choice.

            If you have chosen to use a notification channel, simply enter the name of an existing channel to apply its pre-configured settings.
            If you don't have a channel yet, you can create a new one by entering a name here.
            When your automation sends the first notification, it will create the channel on your device.
            After the channel is created, you can customize its notification settings to your preference directly on your device.

            When a new notification with the same tag is sent, it replaces the old one, so you won't get cluttered with multiple notifications for the same appliance.


            You can use the same tag across start and end notifications to ensure only one active notification remains throughout the automation.


            If this input is left blank, no tag will be applied and each notification will be treated as separate.


            For best results, use short, unique tags for each automation - for example: `water-leak`, `garage-door`, `back-door-motion`, etc.

            When using action buttons in a notification, enabling an auto action is not necessary for the end actions to work, as pressing an action button will execute the selected action.
            However, if you miss the notification and don't press an action button, enabling the auto action option ensures the end actions will still run after the specified time delay.
